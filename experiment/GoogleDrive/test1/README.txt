For this test to work you need a client_secrets.json file.
You set this up from The Google API console (https://code.google.com/apis/console).

See following for instructions:

NOTE: These are a little out of date (Google GUI has changed) but you should still be able to figure it out

Dec 2015 - The standard pip version of PyDrive did not work for me. I had to get latest from GitHub and install using python setup install

Remember NOT to store the client_secrets.json file in GitHub!!!
